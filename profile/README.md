# Tiledesk is the <b>open source conversational platform<b> that easily connects humans and chatbots

Designed to be open source since the beginning, we actively worked on it to create a totally new, <b>first class customer service platform<b> based on instant messaging.

What is Tiledesk today? It became the open source <b>“conversational app development” platform<b> that everyone needs 😌

You can use Tiledesk to <b>increase sales for your website<b> or for <b>post-sales customer service<b>. Every conversation can be automated using our first class native chatbot technology.
You can also connect your own applications using our APIs or Webhooks.
Moreover you can deploy entire visual applications inside a conversation. And your applications can converse with your chatbots or your end-users! We know this is cool 😎

Tiledesk is <b>multichannel<b> in a totally new way. You can write your chatbot scripts with images, buttons and other cool elements that your channels support. But you will configureyour chatbot replies only once. They will run on every channel, auto-adapting the responses to the target channel whatever it is, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram etc.
