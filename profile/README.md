### Human In The Loop

**Smart handoff from AI to Humans when needed** Complex or ambiguous conversations are intelligently escalated to human agents with full context, ensuring reliable support.
**Self-Learning** AI improves from human interactions. Human responses and feedback from escalated cases are used to train and improve AI agents, fostering a self-learning cycle.
