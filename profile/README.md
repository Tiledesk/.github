Tiledesk is the **open source AI conversational platform** that easily connects humans and chatbots.

Designed to be open source since the beginning, we actively worked on it to create a totally new, **first class customer service platform** based on instant messaging.

You can use Tiledesk to **increase sales for your website** or for **post-sales customer service**. Every conversation can be automated using our first class native chatbot technology.
You can also connect your own applications using our **APIs** or **Webhooks**.
Moreover you can deploy entire **visual applications** inside a conversation.

</p>

And your applications can converse with your chatbots or your end-users! We know this is cool 😎

Tiledesk is **multichannel** in a totally new way. You can train your chatbots to reply with images, buttons and other cool elements that your channels support. But you can write your chatbot replies only once. Each reply will auto-adapt itself to all channels, from Whatsapp to Facebook Messenger to Telegram etc.
